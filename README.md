# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this memo is to provide investors with a detailed analysis of the bike-sharing program using an example of NYC Citi Bike that can be leveraged for Des Moines business proposal.

## Results

We leveraged NYC Citi bike-sharing program data for August 2019 and noted the following trends:

*	The peak hours for bike usage are 8am, 9am, 5pm and 6pm which correlates with rush hours.

*	The primary user of bike-sharing program are men – 65% from total population.

*	The users mostly bike for less than an hour as is shown in the two graphs below

*	From the two graphs below we can conclude that users mostly bike during the rush hours on workdays, whereas for weekends the busiest time is from 9am to 7pm.

*	We can see that most of the program’s users are subscribers, rather than customers. Also, men are the primary users of bikes, which was also supported by our graph above. In addition, the customers mostly use bikes on weekends rather than workdays.

## Results
Based on our analysis, we concluded that most of the bike-sharing programs are subscribers that use bikes during rush hours as transportation to get to work and from work rather than one-time customers who use bikers for leisure on weekends. To get more insights, we suggest looking into annual data rather than just August month.
